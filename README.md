# Future-Projects
A place where I can put all my ideas for projects in one place
     
### My my own game engine    
Either like Unity or Unreal where I can make any game I want using the engine   
-or-   
more realistically, make individual engines that are made for a specific project
- Make my Game 101 Final Project into a digital game
- Make my Game 210 Midterm into a legit game

### Re-Write my Lisp code into Python
- 2 layer, back propagation neural network
- State Space Search to solve the 15-puzzle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle)
- Floating Point Genetic algorithm
- Connect 4 AI
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
