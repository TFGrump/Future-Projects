# Future-Projects
A place where I can put all my ideas for projects in one place.    
Below is written as the header being the main topic, and the bullet points below as "to-do's".   
  
Make my own game engine
---
Either like Unity or Unreal where I can make any game I want using the engine   
-or-   
more realistically, make individual engines that are made for a specific project
- Make my Game 101 Final Project into a digital game
- Make my Game 210 Midterm into a full game


Work more on my Computer Vision Skills
---
- Upload code that I made for projects
